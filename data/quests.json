You request a trout dinner to celebrate his catch at a later time and bid a distracted farewell. As you look to your left, you glimpse a shadow disappearing down a side street. The glimmer from an object catches your eye, but you’ve no idea what it is. How peculiar, the thought enters your head, and exits just as briefly. The urge to give chase is quickly overwhelmed by the memory of the experience before Thomas arrived. Maybe the sideroads are even less safe…\nAs Thomas steps away, you brace yourself for the feeling of being watched to return, but after a few moments, the sky is still clear and shining. It takes you a few moments of deliberate steps forward to remember your goals, but bolstered by the shining sky your pace quickens, hoping to run into Holger.\nAs luck would have it, you run into Holger not 10 minutes later on the east side of town. He looks deep in thought as he stares towards the horizon, a whittling project seems to have been forgotten to his left, a half finished drink on his right.\nHolger motions to you to sit down on the blanket he has spread out, and you join him.

Tell Rosalie thank you.” \nNodding, you realize there is nothing to do but leave and head back to Beatrix’s home empty-handed. \nA flash of inspiration strikes you, and you turn around to give Holger one last gift.",

The smiles of the townsfolk and others you've met in your journey, those memories bring you hope, and your resolve to figure out the mystery of Star is renewed.\nAnd yet, wending your way through the streets and alleys, the trauma of the unsettling shadow again begins to grip you, the sense of someone following you gnaws at your mind. A sound, the scuff of feet comes from behind you and impulsively you glance backwards and the world rushes to greet your face.\nFear seizes your gut and despair overwhelms as a shadow looms over you.

But, with us together, we’ll be unstoppable!” His enthusiasm is infectious as he casts an imposing figure in the daylight, you briefly consider his proposal before your better judgment takes over, and you suggest talking to the rest of the Golden Leaf before he does anything rash. \nOn your walk back Holger’s words ring through your ears “find Buddy…” \nPeculiarly, no more episodes of shadow occur on your trip back. Sometimes, you get the sense of being watched, and even catch a glimpse of a (the?) shadow in the window and a glint of light, but before you can react it’s gone from your vision. \nBuddy notices your nerves and puts a hand on your shoulder, “Nothing will hurt you while I’m here, friend.”\nYou trudge back to Beatrix’s home, feeling strangely comforted on the journey. Arriving back at Beatrix’s you find you’re the first to arrive in her home. Rosalie is nowhere in sight, and neither is Lorn.

He was a soldier then, and he was sent with his battalion to free a group of people that were enslaved for many, many years.\n\nA dispatch was sent to the town ahead of the battalion to allow everyone time to gather. The slaveholders and the enslaved were assembled and waiting when the soldiers arrived. Lorn was given a proclamation to read to the town. The proclamation announced that those currently in the bondage of slavery were freed and would be treated as such. Lorn’s battalion remained in the area only long enough to make sure the proclamation was obeyed, and then they moved on to their next assignment.\n\nTo this day, Lorn worries that he didn’t do enough to help those newly freed people. He did his duty and followed his orders, but those newly freed men and women and children needed more than being released from forced labor. They needed kindness, friendship, and support.\n\nEvery year on this day, Lorn remembers. Then, he tries to find someone around him that needs a little more help and he reaches out to help.\n\nLorn would like everyone in town to join him in celebrating this day of freedom by helping others. Will you join him and remember someone that needs help?",

You see something fall from the raptor’s foot as it disappears further into the forest. “Whatever that thing dropped, I want it.”, Borgen says confidently. “Once we get that, we can keep moving.”",

There are a few signs placed along the edges of the desert.\n“DANGER!” \n“DO NOT ENTER!” \n“NO TRESPASSING” \n“Ahead: Sand”\nBorgen fashions some interesting layering, in an attempt to keep sand from his boots. Jill covers her head in a scarf, and double checks her water supply. You’ve done all the preparations you can, it’s time to move on. \nThe Jundland Desert is beautiful, if not blindingly bright. The sand looks almost golden, and a gentle wisp of wind carries a few golden specks to new dunes. Aside from that though, there’s nothing else to see. It’s not quite as hot here as Ember Lagoon, but it’s a close second while the sun is out. The group walks until the greenery is no longer visible. There are small bits and pieces of things hidden within the sand, but otherwise, there are no landmarks you can find. Each dune looks the same. You hold your compass, thinking maybe it will be useful here. The arrow just spins around and around.\n“I WILL GUIDE. FOLLOW.” ROOMBA marches towards, well, more sand.",

A MESS OF FEATHERS DETECTED!”\n\nROOMBA whirs into motion, cleaning feathers.\n\nStar, unannounced once again with his favorite spell, has shown up to your home.\n\n“I sensed from the sunspot disturbances you had something for me, so hand it over.” His demeanor is strangely intense, and you feel compelled to hand over the letter. Star opens it daintily, and begins reading half aloud and half to himself. His face starts serene but quickly contorts in anger.\n\n“Yes, I’m sure you got it ALL. ON. YOUR. OWN.”\n\nHe continues reading and his face grows red. The lights in your home begin to dim in an alarming fashion.\n\n“Your tricks can’t stop me forever!”\n\nHe continues to grow redder as he continues to read and his face is misshapen at this point. The room begins to expand and you hear snapping and popping that you can't explain. The lights are bright and yet dim all at once.\n\n“Greedy?! WHO'S THE GREEDY ONE?! GREEDY MAGE!?\nI. AM. A. WIZARD!\n\nAt this point, you begin to fear for your own safety. The room is now twice the size you remember it being. Fire is pouring out of your fireplace. Various pieces of furniture are levitating and vibrating uncontrollably.\n\n“YOUR FAMILY STARTED!”\n\nStar is now stomping on the letter and in quite a fit.\n\n“STARS AND STONES AND CURSED CREEK!”\n\nSuddenly, Star seems to realize his loss of control and the room instantaneously reverts to its previous state.\n\nStar takes a few extra moments to compose himself and turns to you with a big smile on his face.\n“Well well well, it seems I could use some more help in the future, and some good food. Maybe you can use this to help us both out now and in the future.”\nHe produces an orb that seems to be simultaneously opaque and completely transparent. \"You'll know what to do with this.\"\nROOMBA has stopped whirring, oblivious to whatever just happened, having finally cleaned up all the feathers as Star disappears in yet another shower of feathers.\n“ALERT! ALERT! FEATHER INTRUDERS! MAN THE BROOMS!”",

She awoke each night not knowing who, when, or where she was. She was so terrified and confused and hungry that she tried to eat a horse, instead of the fish she now remembers that she prefers. She’s very glad to have her memory back.\n\nUnfortunately, Geist still needs your help. The spell that Rosalie repaired was meant to suppress Beatrix’s dragon form and the painful memories of their shared ancient past. Geist was able to remove the spell after Rosalie fixed it in such a creative way, but that brings them back to the original problem. Geist thinks Beatrix will be overwhelmed by the flood of thousands of years of painful memories. She thinks it may destroy Beatrix.\n\nWill you help Geist with a new spell? She wants to take all of their memories, beyond Beatrix’s time in this town, and store them in a flame orb. Then, she would like you to protect the orb until Geist and Beatrix both ask for it.",

With an up-close view of the announcer, you can almost make out the details of his face; he looks familiar.\n\nBefore you know it, you, Thomas, and all the contestants are walking towards a nice, sandy beach where the sun is shining brightly off the rolling waves of the ocean. You and Thomas are ready to start fishing. However, Thomas says his stomach hurts and he goes towards the ocean and pukes. You’re worried that Thomas ate something spoiled so you tend to him for a little bit, but he pushes you away and asks you to continue fishing; he’ll take care of himself.\n\nThe shady duo you saw earlier is fishing a couple of spots down from you, but unfortunately now is not the time to investigate.\n\nYou quickly grab Thomas’ new rod and begin fishing, throwing all the fish you catch into the barrels behind you without a second glance.",

You know you will need a huge amount of fish in the next round just to catch up, in hopes of winning the tournament.\n\nThe cloaked figure sends you off again towards the coast, but this time you sail on a boat towards the vast blue ocean with nothing else in sight, so it seems…\n\nAs Thomas seems to have fully recovered, he exclaims that there are fish practically jumping out at what appears to be a tiny cove in the middle of the ocean. You quickly steer the boat to the area, hand Thomas his fishing rod and grab yours, and rapidly begin fishing.",

It was Holger this whole time!\n\n\nHe thanks you and Thomas for a job well done, and he looks forward to eating the tremendous amount of fish you and the other teams caught for him.

Ric claims that the mayor was perfectly well at their dinner yesterday evening, and that when they parted, the mayor was still alive. However, Lorn was told by the mayor, before that dinner with Ric, that he was going to end the work camp and relieve Ric of his duties. Lorn doesn’t believe in coincidences like this.\n\nAnother dangerous coincidence may arise when the Board of Founders meets tomorrow to appoint an interim mayor. Lorn will be voting for himself, but he’s afraid the other founders may be “convinced” to vote for someone that supports Ric.\n\nLorn thinks it’s time to start preparing an operation to rescue and hide the work camp prisoners, instead of waiting on a change in town policy. Will you help gather supplies for the rescue mission?",

He had a cabin built for him at the Mt. Banon Work Camp, but that’s too far out of the way to handle the day-to-day affairs of the town. He needs to be closer.\n\nInstead of the usual contributions to the relief fund, Ric is asking everyone to take a break and instead help build a mayor’s house for the town. He will use the new mayor’s house as his residence during his interim term, and then it will be a place for the next mayor to reside.\n\nRic requests that you bring a load of building materials and tools to help build the mayor’s house.",

You are someone that he can trust.\n\nCaptain Thomas isn’t sure what caused him to be transported to this world, but before he stepped foot on your world he saw one of your townsfolk being pulled to the world Captain Thomas just left. The man was pulling on a trident laying on the ground while the gate to Captain Thomas’s world was pulling on the man.\n\nCaptain Thomas called to the man and asked if he needed help. The stranger noticed Captain Thomas standing in the gateway and said simply that he didn’t want to leave his trident behind, but the gateway wouldn’t let him take it to the new world.\n\nCaptain Thomas waited with the man. While they waited, Captain Thomas introduced himself. The stranger called himself Poseidon and said it was a pleasure to meet Captain Thomas. Then, Poseidon fell quiet again, seemingly deep in thought.\n\nEventually Poseidon spoke. He told Captain Thomas about some of his greatest adventures. Poseidon traveled to many worlds, but this was to be his last voyage for some time. Then, Poseidon talked about all the friends and family he made on his travels. He said he would continue to watch out for them, but they would wonder where he went. Finally, he asked Captain Thomas to find a new owner for his trident.\n\nCaptain Thomas agreed to find a worthy owner for the trident. Then, Captain Thomas attempted to shake Poseidon’s hand. The gateway prevented the contact.\n\nPoseidon thanked Captain Thomas and then released the trident. The gateway and Poseidon vanished. Captain Thomas was left there alone with the trident.\n\nWill you accept the responsibility of this mighty weapon? Will you also bring Captain Thomas a few things to create a memorial for Poseidon on the spot where the trident was left?",

You feel for the letter in your pocket reassuringly and approach her.\n\nAs if compelled, you hand her the letter you intended to deliver to her in private, and after a moment, she passes it back to you, fear and worry mar her features.\n\nDearest Rosalie,\nYou’re a real peculiar gem. I won’t be able to make it for dinner tomorrow.

Stunned for a moment, you check on your wounded pride and notice Beatrix reading the letter.\n\nAfter a moment, Beatrix begins to speak, but the words seem crisper, and more precise than you expect from her. “Tell us Child, what exactly have you gotten yourself into?”\nRosalie hastily retrieves the note from Beatrix and suggests you gather various tea supplies. You can meet her back at her home with Beatrix in a few days to avoid suspicion from Ric. As you turn to leave, Beatrix places a hand on your shoulder and draws you in closely, whispering, \"Geist really likes her tea with black powder and a bit of a bite, if you don't mind?\"",

His voice is gravelly, and he has a strange accent. “Sorry, these things do NOT go down like carrots. Name’s frank. All lowercase.” He pauses to take another bite. “Let’s make a deal. I’ve got some pranks to pull, but no thumbs. Makes things difficult sometimes.” He doesn’t elaborate further, and crunches down on the last of your daily harvest. “I don’t even like leeks very much. Why’d you grow these things?” He tells you what he needs, and you put some lemons in a barrel. As soon as you put the lid on, the rabbit vanishes. He leaves some strange seeds behind.",

He wanted to experiment to see if it would happen again, and he wanted to see if it would happen to sand from the mainland.\n\nThe sand from the mainland behaved completely normally in all of Captain Thomas' experiments. The sand from the island behaved completely abnormally at sunset, even inside the hourglass.\n\nNow, Captain Thomas wants to try making some glass from the island's sand. Will you help him get the resources for building and using a kiln and a bellows? He'll also need some additional materials to help him make the glass.",

One day he was walking around the island with an orb of the glass that he made. He was looking to see if there were any reactions to the glass from other things on the island. Captain Thomas reached the eastern edge of the island a few minutes before the sun came up. As he was walking along the beach he reached down and pulled up a handful of sand. The excess sand falling from his hand stopped falling and remained in the air until the sun appeared. Then, the sand fell to the ground like normal.\n\nCaptain Thomas brought some of the western shore sand back to his shack and started experimenting. He discovered that this sand behaved very much like the sand near Thomas' shack, but only right before dawn. He also discovered that the two sands don't mix. They repel each other.\n\nWith this new knowledge, Captain Thomas went to explore the middle of the island. Just as he expected, Captain Thomas found that there is a line across the center of the island that is completely devoid of sand.\n\nCaptain Thomas would like to make some more glass using sand from both sides of the island.

    "text": "A few days later, your home remains quiet and noticeably uninterrupted. Trips into town have felt tense and you have intentionally avoided speaking to Beatrix and Rosalie except in passing. After gathering the items for tea, you arrive at Rosalie’s home, ready to discuss the letter and what has her so anxious with Beatrix.\nWhen you arrive, you’re surprised to find a third person sitting in a chair near Rosalie’s fireplace. Lorn greets you warmly and motions for you to join the group. Rosalie looks pensive, and Beatrix seems quiet and unreadable as ever. After sitting, the tense mood of the room becomes too much to bear, and Rosalie breaks the tension by suggesting tea.\nThe group prepare their tea, Beatrix adding some very odd ingredients to her tea in the process. After some time of small talk, the tension in the room again reaches palpable levels, and Lorn quietly draws the letter out of his pocket and says, “So, a peculiar gem?” Beatrix looks intently at Lorn, and for a moment, the fire seems to pulse in intensity, almost exactly at her pace of breathing, but you shake the feeling off as your imagination as Lorn continues, “I’ve heard many things about many various gems, but what do you all know about the power of gems?”\nRosalie blinks and gives Lorn an odd look, “Star hasn’t mentioned many things about gems, he seems to dislike a certain type, but I’ve never taken much notice to be honest.”\nBefore Lorn can reply, Beatrix in a crisp accent cuts him off, “Gems can hold many powers, they attune to the aether of the world, and some types have affinities towards elements and types of magic. For example, many of the elements attune to basic gems like rubies for fire, or emerald for earth. Using gems for magical enhancement is not a common art in the world any longer.”\nRosalie leans back looking surprised in her chair as what you now recognize as the voice of Geist speaks. Lorn takes a moment to process this information before continuing, “Indeed, I’ve heard similar stories about gems and magic, but there are some gems, some very peculiar, that seem to do things that defy a normal explanation.”\nThe fire in the room suddenly burns bright as Beatrix straightens and says, “I remember…fragments. A war! A gem! Pain! Loss…” \nSuddenly, Beatrix crumples to the ground as the fireplace loses intensity. Lorn and Rosalie rush to Beatrix’s aid. Her eyes open slightly, she looks directly at you and says, “I need rest…and the Flame Orb.”\nBeatrix closes her eyes, and Lorn asks you to gather some items to help Beatrix regain her strength.",

On the trip back to Rosalie’s house, several times you notice certain oddities around town. A home door ajar, blinds closed with windows open - at one point you swear you saw shadows that seemed to move even when you stood still. Hairs standing on end, you attempt to look casual as you head towards your destination. The sense of unease does not lift when you enter the house, instead worry and uncertainty are etched upon the faces of your friends. \nLorn explains, “Beatrix needs more time to recover, but we’re worried that her instability could cause serious consequences if she were to transform in town. I suggest we bring her to your farm house before we give her the flame orb. Rosalie has volunteered to cast a spell of illusion on a cart that we can use to transport Beatrix back to your home with little suspicion.” \nRosalie looks at you strangely, “Did you know orange is a great color for illusions? The more it moves the more it stops the illusion from distorting my aether matrix. That said, Beatrix has a very unique aura owing to her unique circumstances, I’m going to need a lot more orange things than I normally would to make sure this spell works.”",

Lorn arrives and begins smoking a pipe, his presence of calm and serenity have an immediate soothing impact to your frayed nerves. Rosalie steps out of the other room, and upon seeing Lorn mentions how thankful she is to him for helping restock some of her other magic supplies.\n“On the contrary, our dear friend here found most of the goods for you, but I did add a little something special for you myself.” Lorn replies. He winks slyly to Rosalie before settling into a chair. \nAfter putting some tea on, Beatrix sits down and invites you all to listen to her tale. She puts a hand on the flame orb and the orb emits a searing light and the words seem to rush out of Beatrix. \n\n“Many years ago, dragons and humans lived in relative peace. Magic was abundant in the land, and tribes grew up around different wizarding traditions. I grew up in such a tribe, but I was not born with any magical talent myself. Our family was well known, and one day, a man came to our tribe asking for help from wizards. Only later did they find out that there was a war between humans and dragons, and before we knew it, the war descended upon our tribe too. \nThe wrath of the dragons was terrible, and despite my pleading with father, the wizarding tribes were upset at the slaughter of humans and fought back. Many, many dragons died, and many of my friends and family died too. During the worst of the fighting, a dragon soared overhead, pleading with everyone to stop fighting and I was caught up in their words. I followed the dragon many miles and found her pleading with her brethren to stop the fighting. Her words fell on deaf ears, but I was so encouraged that I revealed myself to her and that is how Geist and I became comrades. We rushed to another battlefield to plead to stop the fighting, but it fell on deaf ears. In the fighting, Geist was wounded by a mage who held strange powers, and in my grief I screamed and shouted for the fighting to stop, but it never did… they wouldn’t stop fighting. They wouldn’t listen! In that moment, I lost all hope for humanity and dragonkind and laid beside Geist, waiting for the death of the battlefield I knew was inevitable.”\nBeatrix is now openly crying and Lorn puts a hand on her shoulder to comfort her. \nLorn suggests you take a few minutes to let Beatrix regain her composure, and through tears, Beatrix suggests Geist tell you the rest of the story. She asks for some surf and turf, because she’ll likely be hungry anyways, and asks you all to step outside.",

Too much fungus.” He looks like he’s back to normal, as he’s found another bundle of carrots to munch on. “Mind if I stay here for a while? You grow the best carrots, pal.” He doesn’t wait for an answer, and pulls a giant suitcase from your cupboard. You can tell something in his life has changed, but don’t want to press him right now. You don’t have the heart to tell him he can’t stay, and he’s already unpacking his things anyways. Who knew rabbits owned so much stuff?",

Some folks also wondered how Ragvin could stay in business at his prices. The people of the islands that Captain Logan visited expected Ragvin to return within the next few months.\n\nLorn suspects Ragvin and crew may return to Redbrook after they return to the distant islands Captain Logan visited. He thinks it may be time to wait to talk to Ragvin. Sometimes when we’re lost it’s best to stand still and wait for opportunity to come to us.\n\nLorn appreciates all of your help supporting Captain Logan and his crew.

The eggs also seemed to be completely indestructible, at least the one Vincent saw couldn’t be cracked.\n\nThese decorated eggs always appeared in the early spring, and many of the legends said there were only 12 eggs that could be found. When spring ended, the eggs vanished until the following year. Then, the eggs reappeared, hidden in new locations.\n\nA few of the legends spoke of a 13th golden egg that held vast powers or wealth or something like that. No one ever found the 13th egg in any of the stories.\n\nVincent would like you to keep an eye out this spring for mysteriously decorated eggs in strange places. If the two of you can find the 12 springtime eggs, maybe you can find the golden egg too. Vincent would be happy to evenly split any profit that could be made from the golden egg.\n\nIf you’re interested, just bring any strange eggs you find to Vincent to prove and secure.",

After several seconds, you all step outside and see what you can only believe to be a dragon. Geist dwarfs your home, and she’s more majestic than a mountain. As she lowers her head to address you, flame crackles from her nose and a different fire burns in her eyes. It can only be described as sheer intelligent determination.\n\n“Greetings, I am Geist, and I owe you my unending thanks and gratitude for your care and friendship of my dear friend Beatrix. Rest assured that she is well and unharmed. This has been a traumatic several weeks for her, and I hope to ease her pain by telling you the rest of our story. I know you don't know me, but I know you all very well, as well as Beatrix herself does. Our shared memories make you all so familiar to me, I apologize if I address you all as if I've known you for years, because, you see, I have.\n\nIn that moment, so long ago, when Beatrix laid herself down beside me, I wept for the state of the world, for the wars and hatred that even I did not understand. To see so small a human laid low in empathy broke my heart, and it was in that moment of sadness and desperation to not see the world torn apart that something deep inside me changed. As I bled out from my strange wound, I blacked out, and when I came to, I was not me, but I was a part of Beatrix, and she was a part of me.\n\nWe eventually learned that only one of us could manifest at once, and through our experiences, Beatrix became so despondent that the only thing I could do for my dear friend was lock our memories away and give her a fresh start in a small village to live our life as normal as possible.\n\nI tell you this, because I believe the injustices we have seen Ric impose on our small town are as cruel as we have ever witnessed, and we know the loss and pain of friend and family. I want to help so I offer you this, the knowledge I have of the peculiar gem. Indeed, I have heard of it and I know it has power that neither Beatrix nor I understand. It seems crucial to understand why Star might have mentioned it now, and together we should seek this item out.”\n\nThe group stands around for a moment, deep in thought, when Lorn breaks the silence, “I have heard of this peculiar gem from travelers before, passed down by generations, its value incalculable to anyone. It seems to me the best path forward would be to speak with our resident collector, Cecil, mayhap he has heard of this gem, or has acquired it himself? I have no other leads to offer at this time, unfortunately.”\nEveryone agrees this seems like a reasonable first step, and the group decide it best to bring Cecil an offering of goodwill, knowing he is more open to talking about his collection when he’s adding to it.",

Cecil’s house is an oddity, older than many other homes in the town, but it has always seemed to come through tragedy untouched and looking quite pristine.\n\nRosalie knocks on Cecil’s door and at first, there is no answer. A few moments later, the large front door opens slowly, and Cecil appears with an annoyed look on his face. His eyes quickly flit to Rosalie and before she says anything, he looks to you and says quietly, “You may enter. The mage’s pupil is not allowed in under any circumstance. These are my terms.” His eyes look like they will brook no argument and Rosalie gives you a quizzical look before stepping away from the door.\n\nCecil opens the door wider and allows you inside. The majesty and size of his home is not lost on you in that moment, as the door opens to a great hallway full of trinkets and baubles that distract the eye and glitter in unique and fascinating ways. Cecil walks you to a room you’ve never been in before and your eyes are drawn to even more trinkets and the energy core you brought back from Romuska, placed on a mantle in a base overseeing the room. You notice a kind of black cord coming down the side of the mantle but before you can figure out where it goes, Cecil interrupts your reverie by coughing gently.\n\n“I know why you’re here, and I need your help. You see, Ric has been asking me for more and more money lately to fund his operation. Obviously, money is easy to come by, but I need to replenish my collection of items I sell to various vendors. In return, I will tell you what I know.”\n\nYou see no other avenue forward, and Cecil hands you a list of items he wants you to acquire. It’s strangely similar to items Rosalie and Star have asked you for in the past.",

The eggs started glowing a soft green, but turned red again when he put the plate down.\n\nVincent picked the plate up again and started walking outside. The eggs glowed green whenever he was moving and got brighter when he moved toward the highland hills. So, he kept walking with the eggs right up to the center of the hills.\n\nSomewhere near the center of the hills, the eggs flashed like noonday sun. Vincent immediately stopped and sat down with the eggs while he waited for his eyes to readjust after the flash. When he finally looked around, Vincent saw something shiny in a knot of grass. It was the golden egg!\n\nThe decorated eggs stopped glowing after that flash, and nothing more happened when Vincent added the golden egg to the plate of decorated eggs. Whatever magic was at work in the eggs seems to be at rest now.\n\nNow, Vincent doesn’t know what to do with the eggs. He would love to make some money from them, but he feels like it isn’t really earned for his part. He’s also plenty satisfied just seeing legends he heard come to life.\n\nVincent thinks you should take the eggs.

This money will be extremely useful in the coming days to make safe the townsfolk all over this area. I see you still plan on visiting other townsfolk, well, if you want my advice, don’t trust anyone that won’t give you anything you want immediately.”\n\nYou leave, Ric’s words echoing in your ears. You decide the best approach is to talk to some of the townsfolk you are better acquainted with, and approach George’s home.\n\nAs luck would have it, George is sitting on his porch playing guitar and singing a song, you pause to listen before approaching him.\n\n“I’d give anything\n\nTo be where you’re at\n\nI’d do anything\n\nTo become what you are\n\nIt’s too late\n\nI don’t have what it takes\n\nI don’t have it\n\nI don’t have it\n\nSo move on\n\nI’m alright\n\nI need to move on now\n\nCause I’m gonna be alright”\n\nThe melody catches your ear, haunting but pleasant. There’s a strange comfort in the words, and you give George a moment to finish his song before you approach him any further.\n\nAfter handing him the gift basket, you ask him about Cecil and any strange occurrences in the town, and George shakes his head, he’s been focused on his music lately and hasn’t paid too much attention to more than he’s had to do for Ric, which are just standard dragon defense tactics.

You look to the sides and though it’s the middle of the day, shadows seem to grow around the houses around you and specks of light glitter in the shadows, like tiny eyes, following your every move.\nThe sense of real danger starts to mount, you furtively glance left to right and where there were once sun lit homes you now see dark houses with windows that give the impression of pervasive spreading darkness – you try to look away but you become entranced with one window, a view of something unfathomable brushes your mind and just as you begin to see flecks of blue a hand wraps around your shoulder and you stifle a scream of terror.\n\nThomas, fishing pole in one hand, smiles at you and gives you a strange look.\n\n“Friend, you’re standing in the middle of the street perfectly still, are you okay?”\n\nYou blink, arms shaking, and the sun has returned to the sky. Thomas ushers you down a side street towards his home. After a few moments, you regain your composure enough to assure Thomas that you are fine and ask him about Cecil and strange happenings.\n\nThomas gives you a second strange look and breaks out in a belly laugh. “Oh, do you mean besides the dragon attack? Or Ric Ryph? Or perhaps you mean the fact that I caught all these fish?!” Thomas proudly shows you a drying rack with three trout.\n\n“Fished ‘em myself! Maybe I’m not a lost cause afterall, eh?”",

Before the population boom, it wasn’t hard to keep the woods and streams clean, but Lorn thinks it may take a little more mindful effort now.\n\nWill you pitch in and help gather up some of the trash littered around the area?",

When the last crate was unloaded from the wagon, Thomas bid his new friends farewell and began to make his way to the edge of town. He was on a mission to update the town population sign along the main road. The mayor said this update was long overdue, and that 175 thousand is a number to celebrate.\n\nBefore Thomas made it more than a few dozen steps along the road, something strange happened. Thomas thought he saw a fairy. So, he followed it. A small, floating glimmer continued to stay just out of his reach for nearly a kilometer, until he arrived at an old stone wall.\n\nAs Thomas got close to the wall, the fairy vanished. Thomas continued to search for the vanished glimmer, but eventually gave up after several fruitless minutes. Instead, he turned his attention, reluctantly, to examining the wall.\n\nThe wall was about knee high and made of intricately locked stones. The stones were worn and smooth and showed no sign of decoration, except at the top of what appeared to be a post. On the top of the stone at the top of the post, Thomas found these words engraved.\n\n“Otipeg Line”\n\nThomas has no idea what Otipeg Line means, but he would love to learn more about it. He’s going to ask Lorn if he knows anything. Thomas is going to catch some fish to bring as a gift to Lorn, in exchange for Lorn helping Thomas figure this mystery out. Will you help Thomas catch a few extra fish to really impress Lorn?",

Beatrix couldn’t believe it. She pulled the rest of the radishes and all were alike, ripe and fully grown.\n\nBeatrix is now tangled in curiosity. She wants to know more about this phenomenon.

So, he reluctantly parted with some of his ancient coins to purchase the entire bin of fruit.\n\nNow, according to the farmer, these peaches should be reaching the peak of ripeness in the next day or so. As they do, Borgen would like to get this new fruit out to several people to test the potential market for these “Peaches of the Unincorporated Southern Arcagos”.\n\nWould you like to try a peach?

It was also clear that there was something stuffed inside the hull. Going against his normal tendency, Holger took the contents of the ship. Holger suspects that Borgen didn’t even know the map was jammed inside the model. So Borgen won’t miss it, but he will likely be very sore about the broken ship.\n\nWill you help Holger put together a gift to make Borgen feel better about his broken model ship?

Each entrance is drawn as a series of broken squiggles.\n\nHolger has no idea what the squiggles could mean, but he isn’t ready to give up on this mystery. He thinks some food might help him think more clearly. Will you bring him some fish to fry and eat?",

He was hoping that he would see something that might shake an idea loose in his brain and help him decipher those squiggles. Eventually, he ended up at the Exchange Center and started talking to Lorn about the map.\n\nAs Holger was drawing out some of the squiggles, Lorn had an epiphany. Lorn saw a coin once with very similar markings to one of the groups of squiggles. At first, Lorn thought he had one of the coins in the exchange center storeroom, but after searching for several minutes he couldn’t find a coin that matched what he remembered.\n\nSince Lorn couldn’t find the coin, he tried to do a simple drawing of it.

After he returned from talking to Vincent, he noticed that the backside of the runestone, that you found, was similar to the squiggles on the southern entrance on the map. So, he put the runestone face down on the map and lined it up with the squiggles. It fit perfectly! It also had a reaction like the coin, where it resists being removed from the map. Strangely, that resistance doesn’t happen with the runestone face up.\n\nIt took Holger a little while to recognize the image created by the runestone and the map, but he’s pretty sure that it’s the small cave not far from Lake Tempest.\n\nNow, Holger wants to go explore the small cave and see if the map is correct.

Without stabilizing the pirate magic, the shutoff mechanism wouldn’t work.\n\nBuddy suggested that Holger find a load of pirate artifacts and bring them to the cave. The artifacts will still have a little pirate magic in them that can be accumulated together and shared with the trap mechanisms. Then, Buddy can turn off the traps and let Holger through the tunnels.\n\nWill you help Holger gather up old pirate artifacts?",
